# gitian-bitcoin-shell-scripts
Some shell scripts based on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md

These scripts may be easier for a noobie to follow than the web page is.

They need to be made a little more robust, and some things such as the VERSION should be parameterized.
